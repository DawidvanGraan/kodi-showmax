This is a <a href=" www.showmax.com">ShowMax</a> plugin for <a href="https://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a> that I'm currently busy with.</br>
This plugin is mean't to work with the new Dash support found in Kodi 17 (Krypton Upwards). It will not work with earlier versions of Kodi. It is still under construction and may or may not work.</br>
This plugin is not affiliated with Kodi or Showmax.
